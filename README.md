# MashuBot

This is my attempt in making a Discord bot as a learning experience. MashuBot will be Fate Grand Order related.

Node_modules and auth.json are in the .gitignore.
auth.json has the bot token

## Commands

When you type the command, "!mashu help", it will display the following commands that MashuBot currently has:
 - !mashu al 
 - !mashu gf 
 - !mashu thanks 
 - !mashu fine 
 - !mashu gj 
 - !mashu hbd 
 - !mashu scold 
 - !mashu baka
 - !mashu headpat
 - !mashu servant (insert firstname/nickname/id)
 - !mashu battle
 - !mashu bad
 - !mashu money
 - !mashu skill (insert firstname/nickname/id)

(README will be updated as i make progress)
